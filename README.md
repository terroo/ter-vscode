## Overview

Terlang is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides syntax highlighting for the Terlang programming language. This extension improves code readability by applying colorization rules to keywords, strings, comments, and other language elements.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for Terlang (`.ter` files)
- Support for single-line (`// comment`) and multi-line (`/* comment */`) comments
- Keyword highlighting (`if`, `while`, `for`, `return`, etc.)
- String highlighting with escape sequence support

## Installation

### From the Marketplace
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for `Terlang` and install the extension.

### Manual Installation
1. Download the `.vsix` package.
2. Open a terminal and run:

## Usage
